1. Class and Obj (example)
2. Class has data/attribute and func/methods
    > Code walkthrough
    > attributes get called itself, methods are called manually
3. Why Python is called OOP? - everything in Python is an object (data structure, data type etc)
4. Advantages of OOPS:
    > You can create your own datatype
    > code reusability
    > debugging
    > easy to colab


5. End to end Project (Chatbook class)
    > function vs method
    > magic method or dunder method
    > self
    > You can create attribute outside class as well

    > encapsulation
    > getter and setter
    > static method

6. Inheritance
    > Inheritance code example
    > Why Inheritance is needed ? (code reusability, parent has no access to child class)
    > What gets inherited ? - Constructor, Non Private attributes, Non Private methods
    > Constructor overloading and Method overloading
    > Super Keyword(can be used inside a class, cannot access variables/attributes)

    > Types of Inheritance- 1. Single|2. Multi Level|3. Hierarchical|4. Multiple <Diamond Problem>|5. Hybrid
